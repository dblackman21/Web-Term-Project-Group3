            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Bridge-IT began in 2023 when our founder, an avid fitness enthusiast, noticed a gap in the market. Fitness trackers were functional but lacked style, forcing users to choose between tracking their health and looking their best. This realization sparked an idea: what if you didn't have to choose?</p>
            <p>After months of research, design iterations, and collaboration with fitness professionals and fashion designers, Bridge-IT was born. We launched with a simple line of premium straps for Whoop devices, and the response was overwhelming. Athletes, professionals, and fitness enthusiasts alike embraced our vision.</p>
            <p>Today, we've expanded our collection to include Fitbit accessories, performance swimwear, and athletic apparel—all designed with the same philosophy: bridge the gap between your fitness goals and your personal style. We're constantly innovating, listening to our community, and pushing the boundaries of what wearable fitness accessories can be.</p>
